Kubernetes plugin will allow you to create new pods remotely from a Clarive instance.

## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Kubernetes to be installed in the destination server to work properly.

To install Kubernetes you need to click [here](https://kubernetes.io/) and follow the instructions.

## Installation

To install the plugin, place the cla-kubernetes-plugin folder inside the `$CLARIVE_BASE/plugins`
directory in a Clarive instance.

### KubernetesPod Resource

To configurate the Kubernetes Pod Resource open:

In **Clarive SE**: Resources -> ClariveSE.

In **Clarive EE**: Resources -> Kubernetes.

You will be able to save your configuration code in this Resource. The main fields are:

- **Pod configuration** - Write the appropiate code for the pod creation.

Configuration example:

    Pod configuration: 
                     apiVersion: v1
                     kind: ReplicationController
                     metadata:
                       name: nginx
                     spec:
                       replicas: 2
                       selector:
                         app: nginx
                       template:
                         metadata:
                           name: nginx
                           labels:
                             app: nginx
                         spec:
                           containers:
                           - name: nginx
                             image: nginx
                             ports:
                             - containerPort: 80

### Kubernetes task

The various parameters are:

- **Server (variable name: server)** - This option lets you choose the server where you wish to execute the command. 
- **User (user)** - User which will be used to connect to the server.
- **Command (command)** - Via this parameter you can to build **("build")** a pod in the remote server or delete it **("delete")**.    
- **Remote path (remote_path)** - Full path where the configuration will be shipped.
- **Creation mode (create_mode)** - You can choose between creating the pod from an already existing file in the server **("File")**, from a Resource **("Resource")**, or create it in the rule **("Create")**.
- **File path (config_file_path)** - For create from file option, write the full path to the pod file in the server.
- **Pod Resource (pod_resource)** - For create option, select the Kubernetes Resource.
- **Pod configuration (pod_config)** - For create option, write the full pod configuration in this variable.
- **Pod config path (delete_pod)** - For delete option, write the full path to the pod file in the server.

**Only Clarive EE**

- **Errors and Output** - These two fields deal with managing control errors. The options are:
   - **Fail and Output Error** - Search for the configured error pattern in the script output. If found, an error
     message is displayed in the monitor showing the match.
   - **Warning and Output warning** - Search for the configured warning pattern in the script output. If found, an error
     message is displayed in the monitor showing the match.
   - **Custom** - If combo box errors is set to custom, a new form is displayed to define the behavior with these
     fields:
   - **OK** - Range of return code values for the script to have succeeded. No message will be displayed in the monitor.
   - **Warn** - Range of return code values to warn the user. A warning will be displayed in the monitor.
   - **Error** - Range of return code values for the script to have failed. An error message will be displayed in the
     monitor.

## How to use

### In Clarive EE

Once the plugin is placed in its folder, you can find this service in the palette in the section of generic service and can be used like any other palette op.

Op Name: **Kubernetes task**

Example:

```yaml
    Server: Remote_server
    Command: Build
    Creation mode: File
    File path: /dir/seconfdir/podConfig.yaml
``` 

### In Clarive SE

#### Rulebook

If you want to use the plugin through the Rulebook, in any `do` block, use this ops as examples to configure the different parameters:

```yaml
do:
   - kubernetes_task:
       server: 'kubernetes_server'  # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'build'             # Required
       remote_path: '/tmp/'
       create_mode: 'Create'
       pod_config: |
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: ReplicationController
            metadata:
              name: nginx
            spec:
              replicas: 2
              selector:
                app: nginx
              template:
                metadata:
                  name: nginx
                  labels:
                    app: nginx
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: nginx
                    image: nginx
                    ports:
                    - containerPort: 80
```

##### Outputs

###### Success

The plugin will return all the console output.

###### Possible configuration failures

**Task failed**

The plugin will return the error from the console output.

**Variable required**

```yaml
Error in rulebook (compile): Required argument(s) missing for op "kubernetes_task": "server"
```

Make sure you have all required variables defined.

**Not allowed variable**

```yaml
Error in rulebook (compile): Argument `Code` not available for op "kubernetes_task"
```

Make sure you are using the correct paramaters (make sure you are writing the variable names correctly).
